# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using Clustering

This project involves segmenting customers based on their behavior using K-Means clustering. The purpose is to uncover distinct customer groups and provide tailored marketing strategies for each.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Apply K-Means clustering on customer behavior data.
- Visualize clusters to understand different customer types.
- Suggest marketing strategies for each cluster.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
  - `pandas` – Data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Visualization
  - `scikit-learn` – Clustering and preprocessing
  - `PCA` – Dimensionality reduction for visualization

---

## 📁 Deliverables

- `Customer segmentation using Clustering T2.ipynb`: Includes
  - Data preprocessing and EDA
  - K-Means clustering
  - Elbow method for cluster optimization
  - PCA-based cluster visualization
  - Strategic suggestions based on cluster insights

---

## ✅ Key Highlights

- 🧹 Cleaned and preprocessed customer dataset (missing values handled, categorical features encoded)
- 📊 Applied **K-Means clustering** to group customers into distinct behavior-based clusters
- 📉 Used **Elbow Method** to determine optimal number of clusters
- 🔻 Applied **PCA** to reduce features for easier 2D cluster visualization
- 🎨 Generated insightful **scatter plots** to visualize customer segments
- 🧠 Added actionable **marketing strategies** for each identified cluster

## 💡 Marketing Strategy Suggestions (example)

| Cluster | Characteristics                              | Suggested Strategy                                  |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 0       | High spenders, loyal customers               | Loyalty rewards, early access to premium products   |
| 1       | Price-sensitive, low engagement              | Discount campaigns, referral programs               |
| 2       | Occasional buyers, moderate engagement       | Personalized emails, product recommendations        |
